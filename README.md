Heroku

To deploy the application to Heroku, follow these steps:

    Create a Heroku account if you don't have one already.

    Install the Heroku CLI by following the instructions on the official website: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.

    Log in to Heroku using the CLI:

bash

heroku login

    Create a new Heroku app:

bash

heroku create

    Set the environment variables for the app using the Heroku CLI:

bash

heroku config:set PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

    Push the code to the Heroku app:

    Visit the app URL to use the GUI.

Note: You may need to add a Procfile to the root directory of the project to tell Heroku how to start the application. Here is an example Procfile:

web: npm start

This tells Heroku to start the application by running the "npm start" command. You can customize this command to fit your specific application.
